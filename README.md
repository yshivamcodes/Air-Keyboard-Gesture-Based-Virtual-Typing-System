# Air Keyboard – Gesture-Based Virtual Typing System

A touch-free virtual keyboard that lets you type using hand gestures tracked in real-time using MediaPipe Hands and rendered using OpenCV.
This project creates a fully functional QWERTY keyboard, includes Shift, Caps, Space, Enter, Backspace, and supports symbol characters.

## Features

✔ Real-time hand tracking (21 landmarks)

✔ Pinch-to-type gesture

✔ Full QWERTY keyboard

✔ Auto-scaling keyboard (adapts to webcam resolution)

✔ SHIFT, CAPS, BACKSPACE, ENTER, TAB, SPACE

✔ Transparent UI with hover + click highlights

✔ Fast and lightweight (no special hardware required)

## How It Works

Webcam captures frames

MediaPipe Hands detects finger landmarks

Index fingertip (8) position is tracked

Pinch with thumb (tip 4 → tip 8 distance) triggers a key press

Pressed key is rendered and text appears above keyboard
